# odin-landing-page

This is my solution to the second project assigned by The Odin Project's 'Foundations' course in web development. 

## Learnings
This was overall a very fun and enriching experience. I got a chance to utilize many of the core concepts I had learned thus far: flexbox (of course), border box, text styling, CSS selectors, and working with Git. Flex is an interesting topic and I enjoyed formulating how I would approach coding each section in HTML and styling it with flex. I learned tidbits of information here and there, such as a flex item needs not have "display: flex" to be a flex item.  I also recalled some older CSS concepts I had forgotten - linebreaks, paragraphs, and emphasized & strong text. 

One of the most valuable things I got out of this was the debugging process, making modular commits, and learning a slew of new Git comands - [attached](https://github.com/Julia-1439/odin-landing-page/blob/main/git_notes.txt) in this repo - to level up my version control. I got a hang of doing modular commits and learned the `git add --patch` command to make more selective commits. I learned how to revert changes, diff index/staged with HEAD, and squash commits. 

I chose to not make many comments on my style sheet, but I did my best to group each section's selectors together. One reason for not labeling each group of selectors was that there was overlap between each section (e.g. one selector used for elements belonging to different sections), so I wasn't sure how to neatly do the labeling. This might be worth revisiting the future when I get to a styling lesson which I expect will come up at some point. 

I'm satisfied with how I was able to avoid deep rabbit holes that deviated from the core principles being taught and not focus so much on getting things perfect. I got better at leaving things less than "ideal" in favor of making more important progress elsewhere. 

## Improvements

One area I wish I was able to use more here was the `flex` property to adjust the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties. Just for my records so I don't forget: flex-basis being auto means it'll check for any specified width to use, and 0 means its minimum width will be the size of its content. The default values for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis are 0, 1, and auto, respectively. 

Another thing I want to improve is my Googling. There are <strong>[many](https://static.semrush.com/blog/uploads/files/39/12/39121580a18160d3587274faed6323e2.pdf)</strong> search operators I do not use that seem could really enhance how I search for things. Another things to work on my my phrasing in searches to net more useful results. 

I would like to revisit the topic of "learning how to learn". I think I'm doing a better job of it lately as I went through the flexbox lesson, using as many different resources as I can and those that would work for me rather than sticking to the prescribed curriculum by TOP (no offense to TOP; there were just some things I needed more clarity on c: ).
